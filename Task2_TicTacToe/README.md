## Task 2 â€“ Tic Tac Toe AI ðŸ¤–

This is Task 2 of the CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship (July 2025 Batch).

In this project, I have developed a console-based Tic Tac Toe game where a human player competes against an unbeatable AI agent powered by the *Minimax algorithm. The AI always plays the best possible move, helping me understand the basics of **game theory* and *search algorithms*.
